# GeoGIF
Project for defining the GeoGIF specification.

## What is it?
A GeoGIF is similar to any GIF file, with addtional metadata regarding geolocation. This information would then be used to geolocate the frames in the file by any GIS viewer on the map in the same way GeoTIFFs are geolocated.

## Who Cares?
This GeoGIF specification
